      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>I am from Chicago, Illinois. I grew up in a neighborhood called Argyle, which is now known as Uptown.
        I am a fourth year CS major here at IIT, and I'm graduating this semester.
        I love all things creative whether that would be music, cinematography, or fashion/clothing. Anything that involves expressing yourself through art.

      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>So far, I've earned: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A high school diploma from Lane Tech College Prep</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If all goes well, I will earn:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A BS in Computer Science from here, Illinois Institute of Technology</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Aside from education, I do not have any certifications. However, this past winter, I was fortunate enough to obtain an internship in this tough job market.
        Here I was tasked the role of a frontend intern, and learned what it's like to create a web page application in the real industry.
